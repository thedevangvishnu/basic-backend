1 - NodeJS vs ExpressJS

    - NodeJS    
        - a js runtime environment that is used to create servers
        - has the capability and built-in functionalities that can create servers
        - creating servers using HTTP in nodejs is extremely difficult, cumbersome and verbose
    - ExpressJS
        - a framework that helps to write code for creating servers and APIs.
        - can be only used if one has node. Node is the main thing
        - creating servers using express is much easier and beginner friendly
        - express at the end of the day, uses http present inside node to create serves.

2 - ExpressJS 

    - A simple, unopinionated and flexible framework for Nodejs that is used to create web and mobile applications and also build APIs.
    - It makes designing and building web applications easier by providing a set of tools to manage HTTP requests, defining routing, managing middleware and more.
    - Mainly used for ruouting. Ohter usage for express include server-side management (data handling, request-response handling), building APis

    - Characteristics:
        - simplicity: simple and unopinionated that allows developers to use it as they see it.
        - flexbility: allows to integrate other libraries and packages to build on top of it.
        - middleware: easy to add and manage various functionalities through middleware in the request-response cycle.
        - routing: defining and managing routes is easier
    

    - Routing
        - Routes
            - "route" refers to the mapping between the client-requested URL (with a particular end-point path) and the server-response to that request. 
            - simply stated, routes are just URLs with particular path that are requested from user. "/", "/profile", "/contact", "/user/lkasfjasfljsdf" are all routes.

        - Routing refers to the "process of defining and managing routes"
    - ejs

3 - Middleware
    - what
    - req, res, next
    - control
